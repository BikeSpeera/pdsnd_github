### Project Title
Bikeshare Project on GitHub

### Description
Describe what your project is about and what it does
This program allows the user to explore the Bikeshare programs in three different cities
Chicago, New York City and Washington, DC
Data can be analyzed by month or day and reports use and user data.

### Files used
Include the files used
Program uses data files chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv
During development I created and used files that were only 10K lines of each of the data files 
called "chicago_10K.csv", "new_yor_city_10K.csv", and "washington_10K.csv" so they would load 
faster and process faster.For testing specific filters like stations and gender I created small 
files from one of the larger files that were names something like "gneder.csv"  and "station.csv".
These files are not included in the repository.
